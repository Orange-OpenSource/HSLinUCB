# HSLinUCB
This repository contains the simulation and environment code used in the paper Horizontal Scaling using Contextual Bandits

## Simulation
Simulation Jupyter notebook can be used without a complete environment installation. See [Simulation notebook](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/HSLinUCB/blob/main/roles/HSLinUCB/files/simulation/README.md)

## Real Environment
The environment can be used to evaluate the algorithm as in the paper on a real platform. The real platform can also be used to execute the playbook in simulation mode.
- [Environment description](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/HSLinUCB/blob/main/Experimental_Environment.md) - describes the environment from low level to components communication.
- [Environment installation](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/HSLinUCB/blob/main/Experimental_Environment_Installation_Steps.md) - describes the environment installation steps on a real Cloud platform.

TO DO: Add virtual machine creation with ansible.
